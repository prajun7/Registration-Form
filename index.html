<!-- 
Based on your refreshed knowledge on DOM manipulation, create a registration form that takes your 
First Name, Last Name, Age, Gender (dropdown), Phone No, Present Address, Permanent Address. 
There will be a checkbox named “Present and Permanent Address same”, 
if the user checks it, Permanent Address will be automatically filled with the value of Present Address.  
Now, upon submitting the form, the following should be met:

1. All fields except Phone No are required. 
Which means, if the user doesn’t fill up the fields, a corresponding error message will be shown in red just after that field. 
If multiple fields are left blank, the same error message would be shown adjacent to the fields

2. The Phone number should be valid and should not contain anything other than numbers. 
If it does, show the appropriate message showing the error (look for isNaN function)

3. The Phone No should have an exact length of 11. If it doesn’t, then show the proper error message adjacent to the field.

4. When the user corrects the errors and submits, the previous errors should be cleared (if any) and then would show an 
Alert saying “Submission Successful”
